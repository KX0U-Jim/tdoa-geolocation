# TDOA Geolocation System

A Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) geolocation system using RTL-SDR receivers with innovative FM audio pattern matching for reference signal synchronization.

## Overview

This project implements a distributed TDOA system that can locate FM transmitters using multiple RTL-SDR collector stations synchronized via reference signals. The key innovation is using **pre-recorded FM audio content to predict and match RF patterns** for precise timing synchronization - eliminating the need for expensive GPS disciplined oscillators.

### Key Features

- **Seamless frequency switching** using librtlsdr-2freq (zero sample loss)
- **Innovative FM audio pattern matching** for reference signal correlation
- **Distributed collector architecture** supporting RTL-SDR V4/V5 with TCXO
- **Precise timing synchronization** without GPS disciplined oscillators
- **Comprehensive data validation** tools for quality assurance
- **Optimized for efficiency** - compiled binaries, pre-allocated memory

### The FM Audio Pattern Innovation

Traditional TDOA systems struggle with FM broadcast signals due to unpredictable modulation. This project solves that by:

1. **Pre-recording** FM audio content from the reference station
2. **Predicting** what the modulated RF signal should look like using FFT analysis
3. **Cross-correlating** predicted patterns against received RF samples
4. **Extracting** precise timing differences between collector stations

This approach transforms the "problem" of complex FM modulation into the "solution" - those complex patterns become unique correlation fingerprints.

## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum System
- 3 RTL-SDR receivers (V4/V5 recommended, with TCXO for stability)
- 3 collector stations (Raspberry Pi 4+ or x86_64 Linux systems)
- Stations positioned in triangular formation for 2D localization
- Internet connectivity for synchronization and data sharing

### Tested Hardware
- RTL-SDR Blog V4 dongles with R828D tuner
- RTL-SDR Blog V5 dongles
- Raspberry Pi 4B (4GB+ recommended)
- x86_64 Linux systems (Ubuntu/Debian)

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tdoa-geolocation.git
cd tdoa-geolocation

# Deploy on each collector station
./deploy.sh
```

### 2. Basic Collection

```bash
# Calculate future start time (30 seconds from now)
start_time=$(($(date +%s) + 30))

# Run collector (reference at 96.9 FM, target at 162.55 MHz)
./collector --duration=10 96900000 162550000 $start_time kx0u

# Validate collected data
./reader kx0u-$start_time.dat 10
```

### 3. Coordinate All Stations

Run the same command simultaneously on all three collectors, each with their unique station ID (kx0u, n3pay, kf0mtl).
